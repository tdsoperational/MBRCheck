Spits out the sha-256 of your MBR alongside some system info.
Good shit if you need to check the integrity of your MBR, i guess.
Needs admin rights.

If you're using MSVC (Ur a goddamn chad), you can compile this shit with this command: cl /EHsc /MD /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS /D_UNICODE /DUNICODE /W4 mbrcheck.cpp

Or just download the binary..

Hope ya liked it!
